Turkish FrameNet
============

## FrameNet

Introduced in 1997, FrameNet (Lowe, 1997; Baker et al., 1998; Fillmore and Atkins, 1998; Johnson et al., 2001) has been developed by the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley, California. It is a growing computational lexicography project that offers in-depth semantic information on English words and 
predicates. Based on the theory of Frame Semantics by Fillmore (Fillmore and others, 1976; Fillmore, 2006), FrameNet offers semantic information on predicate-argument structure in a way that is loosely similar to wordnet (Kilgarriff and Fellbaum, 2000).

In FrameNet, predicates and related lemmas are categorized under frames. The notion of frame here is thoroughly described in Frame Semantics as a schematic representation of an event, state or relationship. These semantic information packets called frames are constituted of individual lemmas (also known as Lexical Units) and frame elements (such as the agent, theme, instrument, duration, manner, direction etc.). Frame elements can be described as semantic roles that are related to the frame. Lexical Units, or lemmas, are linked to a frame through a single sense. For instance, the lemma ”roast” can mean to criticise harshly
or to cook by exposing to dry heat. With its latter meaning, ”roast” belongs to the Apply Heat frame.

## Turkish FrameNet

In this version of Turkish FrameNet, we aimed to release a version of Turkish FrameNet that captures at least a considerable majority of the most frequent predicates, thus offering a valuable and practical resource from day one. Because Turkish is a low-resource language, it was important to ensure that FrameNet had enough coverage that it could be incorporated into NLP solutions as soon as it is released to the public.

We took a closer look at Turkish WordNet and designated 8 domains that would possibly contain the most frequent predicates in Turkish: Activity, Cause, Change, Motion, Cognition, Perception, Judgement and Commerce. For the first phase, the focus was on the thorough annotation of these domains. Frames from
English FrameNet were adopted when possible and new frames were created when needed. In the next phase, team of annotators will attack the
Turkish predicate compilation offered by TRopBank and KeNet for a lemma-by-lemma annotation process. This way, both penetration and coverage of the Turkish FrameNet will be increased.

For Contibutors
============

### Setup.py file
1. Do not forget to set package list. All subfolders should be added to the package list.
```
    packages=['Classification', 'Classification.Model', 'Classification.Model.DecisionTree',
              'Classification.Model.Ensemble', 'Classification.Model.NeuralNetwork',
              'Classification.Model.NonParametric', 'Classification.Model.Parametric',
              'Classification.Filter', 'Classification.DataSet', 'Classification.Instance', 'Classification.Attribute',
              'Classification.Parameter', 'Classification.Experiment',
              'Classification.Performance', 'Classification.InstanceList', 'Classification.DistanceMetric',
              'Classification.StatisticalTest', 'Classification.FeatureSelection'],
```
2. Package name should be lowercase and only may include _ character.
```
    name='nlptoolkit_math',
```

### Python files
1. Do not forget to comment each function.
```
    def __broadcast_shape(self, shape1: Tuple[int, ...], shape2: Tuple[int, ...]) -> Tuple[int, ...]:
        """
        Determines the broadcasted shape of two tensors.

        :param shape1: Tuple representing the first tensor shape.
        :param shape2: Tuple representing the second tensor shape.
        :return: Tuple representing the broadcasted shape.
        """
```
2. Function names should follow caml case.
```
    def addItem(self, item: str):
```
3. Local variables should follow snake case.
```
	det = 1.0
	copy_of_matrix = copy.deepcopy(self)
```
4. Class variables should be declared in each file.
```
class Eigenvector(Vector):
    eigenvalue: float
```
5. Variable types should be defined for function parameters and class variables.
```
    def getIndex(self, item: str) -> int:
```
6. For abstract methods, use ABC package and declare them with @abstractmethod.
```
    @abstractmethod
    def train(self, train_set: list[Tensor]):
        pass
```
7. For private methods, use __ as prefix in their names.
```
    def __infer_shape(self, data: Union[List, List[List], List[List[List]]]) -> Tuple[int, ...]:
```
8. For private class variables, use __ as prefix in their names.
```
class Matrix(object):
    __row: int
    __col: int
    __values: list[list[float]]
```
9. Write \_\_repr\_\_ class methods as toString methods
10. Write getter and setter class methods.
```
    def getOptimizer(self) -> Optimizer:
        return self.optimizer
    def setValue(self, value: Optional[Tensor]) -> None:
        self._value = value
```
11. If there are multiple constructors for a class, define them as constructor1, constructor2, ..., then from the original constructor call these methods.
```
    def constructor1(self):
        self.__values = []
        self.__size = 0

    def constructor2(self, values: list):
        self.__values = values.copy()
        self.__size = len(values)

    def __init__(self,
                 valuesOrSize=None,
                 initial=None):
        if valuesOrSize is None:
            self.constructor1()
        elif isinstance(valuesOrSize, list):
            self.constructor2(valuesOrSize)
```
12. Extend test classes from unittest and use separate unit test methods.
```
class TensorTest(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_inferred_shape(self):
        a = Tensor([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
        self.assertEqual((2, 2), a.getShape())

    def test_shape(self):
        a = Tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
        self.assertEqual((3, ), a.getShape())
```
13. Enumerated types should be used when necessary as enum classes.
```
class AttributeType(Enum):
    """
    Continuous Attribute
    """
    CONTINUOUS = auto()
    """
    Discrete Attribute
    """
    DISCRETE = auto()
```
